# NYC DOE Dashboard

## Introduction
This is my final project for Data Analytics class. This project visualizes data from NYC DOE public schools using Tableau. There are three dashboards: District Level, School Level, and Socioeconomic Analysis. Data was sourced from NYC Open Data, including grades, attendance, graduation and dropout rates, and demographics.

## Technology Stack
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Geospatial Data Handling**: Integration of geographical data for precise mapping
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Tableau's interactive features and filters
  
## Methodology
Data was collected, cleaned, and integrated datasets using district numbers and school names. Geometrical data for districts and school locations provided spatial context.
